## Today's programme

Today we will learn about data wrangling, or how to get your data into R and transform them for visualization and modeling. The workhorse for these tasks is the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package, part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite. 

![*Data wrangling*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j8ihgwbbbgnjjuo/data-science-wrangle.png?dl=1)

In the interactive tutorial part, we will cover

* Selecting variables with `select()`
* Arranging observations with `arrange()`
* Filtering observations with `filter()`
* Creating new variables with `mutate()`
* Summarise data with `summarise()`
* Chaining transformations with the pipe `%>%`
* Importing data into R 
* Tidying data 
* Joining tables

We will use a subset of the daily COVID epidemiological data from [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)

## Selecting variables

### Let's have a look at the dataset
```{r select1, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```

### Selecting individual columns
```{r select2, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
    colnames()
```
```{r select2-solution}
## by column name
select(covid, country)
select(covid, total_tests)
select(covid, country, total_tests)
select(covid, total_tests, country)

## by column position
select(covid, 1, 5)

## by column position and name
select(covid, 1, country)
```

### Selecting column ranges
```{r select3, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
  col_names()
```
```{r select3-solution}
## by column names
select(covid, new_cases:total_cases_per_million)

## by column position
select(covid, 6:11) ## by positions
```

### Excluding columns
```{r select4, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
    colnames()
```
```{r select4-solution}
## by column names
select(covid, -iso_code)
select(covid, -date:-human_development_index)

## by column position
select(covid, -4:-59) ## by positions
```

### Helper functions
```{r select5, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
    colnames()
```
```{r select5-solution}
### select columns based on pattern matching
select(covid, starts_with("new"))
select(covid, ends_with("rate"))
select(covid, contains("case"))

### all columns helper
select(covid, everything())
select(covid, country, everything())
```

## Arrange observations
```{r arr1, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
    colnames()
```
```{r arr1-solution}
arrange(covid, new_cases)
arrange(covid, desc(new_cases))
arrange(covid, desc(date), desc(new_cases))
```

## Short exercises 1
```{r sel-ex1, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r sel-ex1-solution}
select(covid, contains("total"))
```

``````{r sel-q1, echo=FALSE}
question("Select all columns that contain the string \"total\". What is the name of the variable in the fifth column?",
         answer("total_deaths"),
         answer("total_tests", correct = TRUE),
         answer("total_vaccinations")
)
```
```{r sel-ex2, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r sel-ex2-solution}
arrange(covid, desc(total_cases))
```

``````{r sel-q2, echo=FALSE}
question("Which country has the most total cases?",
         answer("United States", correct = TRUE),
         answer("United Kingdom"),
         answer("Belgium")
)
```

## Filter observations

### Basic filters
```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
    colnames()
```
```{r filter1-solution}
filter(covid, country == "Denmark")
filter(covid, continent != "Europe")
filter(covid, total_cases < 100)
filter(covid, new_cases > 1000)
filter(covid, date %in% c(ymd(20200301), ymd(20200302)))
```


### Multiple filters
```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
    colnames()
```
```{r filter2-solution}
filter(covid, country == "Denmark", date == "2020-03-01")
filter(covid, country == "Denmark", date == "2018-03-01")
filter(covid, country == "Denmark" | date == "2018-03-01")
filter(covid, !(country == "Denmark" | date == "2018-03-01"))
filter(covid, is.na(new_cases_smoothed))
filter(covid, !is.na(new_cases_smoothed))
```

### Other useful filters
```{r filter3, exercise = TRUE}
covid %>%
    colnames()
```
```{r filter3-solution}
### select rows by index
slice(covid, 10)
slice(covid, 1:10)

### select rows with distinct entries 
distinct(covid, country)
distinct(covid, country, continent)
distinct(covid, continent)

### select rows with top N values of variable
top_n(covid, 10, new_cases)
top_n(covid, 10, date)
top_n(covid, 10, country)
```

## Create variables

### We first create a subset of the data
```{r mutate1, exercise = TRUE}
covid_small <- select(covid, country:new_cases, population) %>%
    filter(date == "2021-01-01")
covid_small()
```

### Create a single new variable
```{r mutate2, exercise = TRUE}
covid_small
```
```{r mutate2-solution}
mutate(covid_small, total_cases_thousands = total_cases / 1000)
mutate(covid_small, previous_cases = total_cases - new_cases)
mutate(covid_small, new_cases_per_100k = new_cases / population * 100000)
```

### Reuse created variable
```{r mutate3, exercise = TRUE}
covid_small
```
```{r mutate3-solution}
mutate(covid_small, total_cases_fraction = total_cases / population)
mutate(covid_small, total_cases_fraction = total_cases / population, total_cases_percent = total_cases_fraction * 100)
```

### Keep only the newly created variables
```{r mutate4, exercise = TRUE}
covid_small
```
```{r mutate4-solution}
transmute(covid_small, total_cases_fraction = total_cases / population, total_cases_percent = total_cases_fraction * 100)
```

## Short exercise 2
```{r filter-ex1, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r filter-ex1-solution}
 filter(covid, country == "Sweden", new_cases > 1000)
```

```{r filter-q1, echo=FALSE}
question("Select all observations from Sweden and with greater than 1000 new cases (`new_cases`). Which was the first day where over 1000 cases were recorded?",
         answer("2020-07-03"),
         answer("2020-06-03", correct = TRUE),
         answer("2020-07-05")
)
```


## Summarise observations

### Basic summarise
```{r summ1, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r summ1-solution}
summarise(covid, max_new_cases = max(new_cases))
summarise(covid, max_new_cases = max(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE))
```


### Grouped summarise
```{r summ2, exercise = TRUE}
covid_by_country <- group_by(covid, country)
covid_by_country
```
```{r summ2-solution}
## summarise across all observations
summarise(covid, max_new_cases = max(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE))

## summarise across all observations within grouping variable
summarise(covid_by_country, max_new_cases = max(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE))
summarise(covid_by_country, missing_new_cases = sum(is.na(new_cases)))
```

### Counting
```{r summ3, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r summ3-solution}
count(covid, country)
count(covid, date)
count(covid, date, sort = TRUE)
count(covid, country, date)
```


## The pipe

### Basic chaining of commands with the pipe operator `%>%`
```{r pipe1, exercise = TRUE}
covid_by_country <- group_by(covid, country)
summarise(covid_by_country, max_new_cases = max(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE))
```
```{r pipe1-solution}
group_by(covid, country) %>%
  summarise(max_new_cases = max(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE))

group_by(covid, country) %>%
  summarise(max_new_cases = max(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(max_new_cases))
```

### A complex wrangling example

```{r pipe2, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r pipe2-solution}
select(covid, country, date, new_cases, population) %>%
    filter(date > ymd(20201224), date < ymd(20210101)) %>%
    group_by(country, population) %>%
    summarise(avg_new_cases = mean(new_cases)) %>%
    mutate(avg_new_cases_per_100k = avg_new_cases / population * 100000) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    arrange(desc(avg_new_cases_per_100k))
```

### Piping into ggplot
```{r pipe3, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r pipe3-solution}
select(covid, country, date, new_cases) %>%
    filter(country %in% c("Denmark", "Sweden")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = new_cases, colour = country)) + 
      geom_point()
```

## Short exercise 3
```{r pipe-ex1, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r pipe-ex1-solution}
group_by(covid, country) %>% summarise(new_cases = median(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r pipe-q1, echo=FALSE}
question("Calculate the median of the number of new cases (`new_cases`) for each country. What was the median number of new cases in Denmark?",
         answer("502"),
         answer("125"),
         answer("244", correct = TRUE)
)
```
```{r pipe-q2, echo=FALSE}
question("Which row number contains the result for New Zealand?",
         answer("1"),
         answer("4", correct = TRUE),
         answer("5")
)
```

### Pivot table longer
```{r tidy1, exercise = TRUE}
pop
```
```{r tidy1-solution}
pop %>%
    pivot_longer(pop_65_plus:pop_12_24)
pop %>%
    pivot_longer(pop_65_plus:pop_12_24, names_to = "age_group", values_to = "population")
```

### Pivot table wider

pop %>%
    select(country, year, pop_6_11, pop_12_24, pop_25_64) %>%
    pivot_longer(-country:-year) %>%
    mutate(name = gsub("pop_", "", name)) %>%
    separate(name, into = c("age_low", "age_high"))
```


## Joining tables

```{r join1}
covid_small <- select(covid, country:new_cases, population) %>%
    filter(date == "2021-01-01") %>%
    mutate(yr = year(ymd(date)))

## Anti join, keep rows not matching keys
covid_small %>%
    anti_join(df)
```


## Larger exercises

### Exercise 1
Using the full `covid` dataset as starting point, calculate the test positivity rate, averaged per month for each year and country, and save the output to a new variable. This can be achieved with the following steps:

* Separating the values in the `date` column into year, month and day components using `separate()`
* Grouping the resulting table by country, month and year
* Calculating the average of the test positivity rate (`new_cases` divided by `new_tests`) within groups

```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r ex1-hint-1}
d <- covid %>%
    select(date, country, new_cases, new_tests) %>%
    separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"))
```
```{r ex1-hint-2}
d <- covid %>%
    select(date, country, new_cases, new_tests) %>%
    separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
    group_by(country, month, year) %>%
    summarise(cases_per_test = mean(new_cases/new_tests, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(pos_rate = cases_per_test * 100) %>%
    ungroup()
```
Examining the resulting table, answer the following questions:

```{r ex1-q1, echo=FALSE}
question("Which month had the lowest positivity rate in Denmark?",
         answer("March 2020"),
         answer("June 2020"),
         answer("July 2020", correct = TRUE)
) 
```
```{r ex1-q2, echo=FALSE}
question("In which countries occurred the five months with the overall highes positivity rates?",
         answer("Nigeria, United Kingdom, Sweden"),
         answer("Nigeria, United Kingdom, United States", correct = TRUE),
         answer("United States"),
         answer("United States, Sweden")
) 
```

### Exercise 2
Using the full `covid` dataset as starting point, calculate and plot a 7 day rolling average of new cases for Denmark and Sweden. This can be achieved with the following steps:

* make a subset of the data containing only observations from Denmark and Sweden
* select the variables containing the data for date, number of new cases and country
* create a new variable, calculating the average number of cases for a seven day window centered on each date
* use ggplot to visualise the resulting table, mapping the colour aesthetic to the `country` variable

For calculating the 7-day average, we will use the `slide_dbl` function from the `sliders` package. You can find an example of how to use it on the package [GitHub page](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/slider) in the "Examples" section.

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE}
covid
```
```{r ex2-hint-1}
d <- filter(covid, country %in% c("Denmark", "Sweden")) %>%
    select(date, country, new_cases) %>%
    group_by(country)
```
```{r ex2-hint-2}
d <- filter(covid, country %in% c("Denmark", "Sweden")) %>%
    select(date, country, new_cases) %>%
    group_by(country) %>%
    mutate(new_cases_avg = slide_dbl(new_cases, ~mean(.x), .before = 3, .after = 3))
```
```{r ex2-solution}
d <- filter(covid, country %in% c("Denmark", "Sweden")) %>%
    select(date, country, new_cases) %>%
    group_by(country) %>%
    mutate(new_cases_avg = slide_dbl(new_cases, ~mean(.x), .before = 3, .after = 3))

ggplot(d, aes(x = date, y = new_cases_avg, color = country)) +
    geom_point(size = 1) +
    geom_line()
```
